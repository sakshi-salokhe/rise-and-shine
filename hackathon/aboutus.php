			In the present scenario, people are quite busy with their hectic
			schedules so even though they are interested in donations,they don't
			get time for the same.
			<br>
			There should be some easy and  convenient way through which
			people may easily donate to the needy people. 
			<br>
			<b><i>‘Help The Needy’</i></b> project is an initiative to serve to this need. In this 
			project, Donors,who would like to donate can easily contact the <b><i>‘Help the Needy’</b></i>
			team  with their details (through this website) like name, email id, contact no., 
			complete address and information about the items they want to donate.  
			Our team will collect the items from the donor’s "pick up address" and it can 
			redistributed it to the Receivers, like the NGOs, Orphanage,etc. Things to be 
			donated could be stationery products, clothes, food(like flour,rice sacks,etc),
			blankets,etc. 
			The available items will be displayed to the receivers once they log in.
			The team can then redistribute the collected items accordingly.
			<br>
			This project is mainly proposed for a noble cause and focuses on providing help 
			to the needy people by making the donation process easy.
